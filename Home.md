CS|LING|QTM 329 - Computational Linguistics
=====

This course focuses on the analysis of plain text, syntactic and semantic structures, ontologies and taxonomies, discourse and distributional semantics, as well as their applications in computational linguistics. For plain text analysis, regular expressions and n-gram models will be discussed. For syntactic analysis, phrase structures and dependency grammars will be discussed. For semantic analysis, predicate argument structures and abstract meaning representation will be discussed. For discourse analysis, document clustering and question answering will be discussed. For distributional semantics, word embeddings and topic modeling will be discussed. Homework assignments may involve big data processing using cloud computing. Prerequisites: CS 171 (CS and LING students) or QTM 220 (QTM students).
