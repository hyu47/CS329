CS329: Computational Linguistics
=====

This course will focus on the analysis of syntactic and semantic structures, ontologies and texonomies, distributional semantics and discourse, as well as their applications in computational linguistics. For syntactic analysis, phrase structure and dependency grammars will be discussed. For semantic analysis, predicate argument structures and frame semantics will be discussed.  Computational lexicons such as Treebank, PropBank, WordNet, and FrameNet will also be discussed in depth.  Advanced topics such as distributional semantics and clustering algorithms will be discussed with a focus on their applications. Prerequisites: CS170, QTM220, or LING201.
